Pac Men Exercise

Project description:
This project is a simple kind of game using a classic Pacman type character. The game has 2 buttons 
"Add PacMan" and "Start Game", the "Add PacMan" button can be pressed as many times as desired adding 
a PacMan character at varrying places on the screen.Pressing the "Start Game" button will send all the 
PacMen moving at various velocities and bouncing off the edges of the screen.
I was given source code for this project and built the factory function so the PacMen could be 
repeatedly called.

How to run:
this project is meant to run on a web browser. To run this project yourself, save all of its files in 
a single location on your machine. Next drag and drop the "index.html" file onto your web browser, 
Google Chrome recommended. Now the program is operational and you can click the button to run the 
route.

Roadmap for improvements:
Future improvements to this code could be making it so that different classic PacMan images appear such
as the ghosts and Ms. PacMan along with PacMan. Also adding more variation by having them change 
velocity on bounce.
